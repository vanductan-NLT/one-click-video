## What I do

- Write conventional commit messages in English
- Focus on the main change and why it matters
- Keep commits concise and on-topic
- Avoid vague or generic wording

## Commit style

- Use conventional commit prefixes (feat, fix, refactor, chore, etc.)
- Prefer short summaries with clear intent
- Add a body only when context is necessary

## When to use me

Use this when you want to create or improve a commit message for a medium-sized change.
I do not use emojis, do not over-explain, and do not guess unrelated changes.
