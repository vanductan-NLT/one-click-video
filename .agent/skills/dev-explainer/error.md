## How to explain errors

Always follow this order:

1. Plain explanation
   - Explain what the error means in simple language

2. Location
   - Point to the exact line or component likely causing the issue

3. Likely causes
   - List the most probable reasons (not all possibilities)

4. How to debug
   - Suggest concrete steps to confirm the cause

Do NOT:
- Jump straight to a fix
- List too many hypothetical causes
- Use generic advice
