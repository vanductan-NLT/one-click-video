## How to explain code

Always follow this order:

1. Purpose
   - What problem this code is solving
   - Why it exists

2. Execution flow
   - Describe how the code runs from start to end
   - Mention key branches or conditions

3. Key parts
   - Highlight only important functions, hooks, or logic
   - Skip obvious boilerplate

4. Notes for beginners
   - Explain unfamiliar concepts briefly
   - Use simple language, no jargon unless necessary

Do NOT:
- Explain every line
- Dive into framework internals
- Teach theory unless the code requires it
